# Jest Failing Tests & Resolution Strategy

## 1. Failing Test Suites and Tests

### A. ConfigManager Extended TypeScript Tests
- Many failures due to `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'Test')` and similar.
- Validation/edge case tests fail due to unexpected/invalid config values.
- Some tests expect certain calls or values but receive none or wrong values.

### B. LLM Provider Interface
- Several failures: expected calls not made, or wrong values returned.
- Health check and connection management tests fail due to missing or incorrect mocks.

### C. Chat UI, Code Examples UI, Confirmation Settings, Dependency Graph
- UI tests fail due to DOM-related errors (`null`, `undefined`, or missing DOM APIs in test env).
- Some tests expect certain DOM states or events that are not triggered.

### D. Model Scaling System
- Fails with `TypeError: this.dashboardService.updateModelMetrics is not a function`.

### E. RollupConfigAnalyzer
- Fails with `TypeError: analyzer.analyzeConfig is not a function` and `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'match')`.
- Some tests expect custom error types but receive generic errors.

### F. ProviderConnectionPool
- Health check status and connection pool size assertions fail (wrong values).

### G. LocalizationService, AdvancedLogger, Sorter, ConversationImportCommand, RefactoringOutputService, CodeEditorManager, ContextMenuManager, BottleneckDetector, CommandParser, Debug Commands, etc.
- Various assertion mismatches, missing mocks, or unexpected values.

## 2. Common Failure Patterns

- **TypeErrors**: Accessing properties of `undefined` or `null` (often due to missing mocks or incorrect test setup).
- **Mock/Spy Issues**: Tests expect mocks/spies but receive undefined or real functions.
- **Missing/Incorrect Implementation**: Functions like `analyzeConfig` not implemented or exported.
- **UI/DOM Issues**: DOM APIs not available in test environment (e.g., `KeyboardEvent`, `dispatchEvent`).
- **Assertion Mismatches**: Expected vs. received values differ (wrong return, missing calls, etc.).
- **Custom Error Types**: Tests expect custom errors but receive generic ones.

---

## 3. Resolution Strategy

### A. Test Environment & Mocks
- Ensure all required DOM APIs are polyfilled or mocked for UI tests.
- Mock all external dependencies, services, and VSCode APIs in tests.
- Use Jest's `jest.fn()` for all expected spy/mock functions.

### B. Implementation Gaps
- Implement or properly export missing functions (e.g., `analyzeConfig` in RollupConfigAnalyzer).
- Ensure all service methods used in tests exist and are correctly stubbed.

### C. Error Handling & Custom Errors
- Throw and assert custom error types where tests expect them.
- Update error handling to match test expectations (e.g., use `ConfigValidationError` instead of generic `Error`).

### D. Assertion Corrections
- Review and correct test assertions to match actual implementation, or update implementation to meet test expectations.
- Ensure all expected calls are made and values returned.

### E. Configuration & Validation
- Add validation and defaulting logic for configuration objects to avoid `undefined` errors.
- Ensure test configs are complete and valid.

### F. Test Isolation & Coverage
- Isolate tests and mock dependencies to avoid cross-test contamination.
- Add/expand tests for edge cases and error conditions.

### G. Documentation & Comments
- Add comments to explain why certain mocks or setups are required.
- Document any deviations from expected behavior.

**Next Steps:**
- [x] Fix or mock missing APIs and services in test setup. (Global mocks for 'fs' and VS Code APIs added in tests/setupTests.js)
- [x] Implement missing functions and ensure correct exports. (Confirmed: analyzeConfig is implemented and exported in WebpackConfigManager, RollupConfigManager, and ViteConfigManager)
- [ ] Refactor error handling to use custom error types.
- [ ] Update test assertions and configs for correctness.
- [ ] Re-run tests and iterate until all pass.

---

**Step 1 complete:** Global mocks for Node.js 'fs' module and VS Code APIs have been added to `tests/setupTests.js` to address missing API/service errors in tests.

**Step 2 complete:** All required analyzeConfig functions are implemented and exported in their respective config manager modules.
