## setup

## updating
###  update - task list
- review the todo.md and update the status of completed and in-progress tasks.
- add an indicator as prefix if missing. it shall be like:
  - "- [ ]" for tasks not touched yet
  - "- [/]" for tasks in progress
  - "- [X]" for tasks completed
  - "- [-]" for do not touch task
  - add an percentage estimation as suffix to indicate how much of the bullet point is completed. It shall be like " (99%)"

### update tests - new components
@workspace
- Implement unit tests for the new component
- Add integration with the existing system

### update - requirements list
#codebase 
- review all installed modules
- resolve dependencies.
  - select an alternate module to install if there is a deadlock in version requirments
  - regenerate zzzbuild\requirements.txt

## refactoring
### refactor - by reviewing workspace
@workspace
- Add missing init.py files in all directories
- Review and standardize file names and paths
- Update any documentation to reflect the new import paths

### refactor - modules
@codebase
- review all installed modules
- resolve dependencies.
  - select an alternate module to install if there is a deadlock in version requirments
  - regenerate tools\requirements.txt

### refactor - generic
@codebase
- review all code
- refactor code to improve readability and maintainability
- update documentation to reflect the changes

### refactor - code
- refactor the entire project.
- use the markdown file refactoring-progress.md to reflect which files have been processed and which ones are missing.
- refactor all the files step by step, beginning with the largest files and finally update the markdown files refactoring\refactoring-plan.md and refactoring-progress.md

## coding
### coding - normal coding by list
@workspace
Commence with the next most reasonable task in todo.md.
- Prefer tasks which already have been started.
  - add an indicator as prefix if missing. it shall be like:
    - "- [ ]" for tasks not touched yet
    - "- [/]" for tasks in progress
    - "- [X]" for tasks completed
    - "- [-]" for do not touch task
  - add an percentage estimation as suffix to indicate how much of the bullet point is completed. It shall be like " (99%)"
- generate code
- update todo.md after the task at hand has been finished.
- Once a task has reached a status of 100%, move the bullet point from todo.md to finished.md


## documentation
### documentation - verify correctness of task files
- first run a full comparison of all completed tasks listed in todo.md and finished.md against the code in the workspace.
  - Make sure the status completed "[X]" reflects the state of the related code.
  - add any completed task missing in todo.md and finished.md to finished.md
- move all finished items from todo.md and finished.md to finished.md
  - re-organize todo.md and finished.md
- re-organize todo.md
  - compare todo.md against todo.md and finished.md
    - Delete all duplicate tasks in todo.md
- re-organize todo.md

### documentation - finished task files
@workspace
reorganize finished.md
- The finished.md file is a record of completed tasks, and every entry needs to be preserved, not summarized or removed
- group the categories
- remove duplicates
  - DONT delete ANY entry that is not a duplicate
- Create a consistent format for each category
  - Ensure proper formatting (headers, bullet points, etc.)
  - translate everything to english if different spoken language found.
