# File Casing Issues and Solutions

## Problem

This project was experiencing TypeScript errors related to file casing inconsistencies:

1. Files were imported with inconsistent casing:
   - `Logger.ts` vs `logger.ts`
   - `ConversationManager.ts` vs `conversationManager.ts`
   - `CoreAgent.ts` vs `coreAgent.ts`

2. These inconsistencies cause errors on case-sensitive file systems (like Linux) and when different developers work on different operating systems.

## Solution

We implemented several scripts to fix these issues:

1. `fix-casing.js`: Renames files to use consistent casing (lowercase)
2. `fix-imports.js`: Updates all import statements to use the correct casing
3. `fix-type-errors.js`: Fixes common TypeScript type errors across the codebase

The scripts can be run individually or all together using:

```bash
npm run fix-all
```

## Prevention

To prevent these issues from recurring:

1. We enabled `forceConsistentCasingInFileNames` in `tsconfig.json`
2. Always use consistent casing (lowercase) for file names and imports
3. Be especially careful when working across different operating systems

## Additional TypeScript Fixes

Beyond casing issues, we fixed several other TypeScript issues:

1. Fixed the `timestamp` property in `LogEntry` to correctly use `Date` type
2. Fixed function parameter types with optional notation (`param?: type` instead of `param: type | undefined`)
3. Updated interface implementations to include all required properties

After running the fix scripts, restart VS Code and run `npm run compile` to verify all issues are resolved.
