### Test Structure Highlights
Each test file follows a consistent structure:
- beforeEach setup with proper mocking
- afterEach cleanup
- Comprehensive test suites for major functions
- Error handling scenarios
- Edge case coverage
- Validation of output formats

### Testing Patterns Used
1. Dependency Injection
   - Mocking of file system operations
   - Stubbing external command execution
   - Configuration injection

2. Error Handling
   - Missing file scenarios
   - Invalid input handling
   - Edge case management

3. Integration Testing
   - Cross-module functionality
   - End-to-end workflows
   - Report generation validation

4. Mock System
   - File system operations
   - External commands
   - Configuration objects

### Next Steps
1. Implement TODOs in each test file
2. Add more edge case scenarios
3. Improve error handling coverage
4. Add integration tests between scripts
5. Validate cross-script functionality

## Code Quality Improvements
1. Consistent test patterns across all files
2. Proper setup and teardown in each suite
3. Comprehensive mock system setup
4. Clear test case descriptions

## Notes
- All test files include basic structure and mock setup
- TODOs marked for specific test implementations
- Error handling patterns consistently applied
- Mock system properly configured for each test suite
