# Refactoring Status

## Overview
This document tracks the status of the comprehensive refactoring effort for the VS Code Copilot PPA (Productivity and Performance Analyzer) extension. The goal is to improve code quality, maintainability, and performance while modernizing the codebase.

## Objectives
1. Improve code organization and modularity
2. Implement consistent patterns and best practices
3. Enhance type safety and error handling
4. Optimize performance and resource usage
5. Improve test coverage
6. Update documentation
7. Remove deprecated code and consolidate duplicated functionality

## Technical Debt Metrics
- Average Cyclomatic Complexity: Acceptable (all previously identified issues have been addressed)
- Code Duplication: Multiple similar analysis patterns identified
- Test Coverage: Incomplete, especially in complex analysis logic
- Documentation: Needs improvement in analysis algorithms

## Progress Summary
- Total Files Processed: 1
- Completed: 1
- In Progress: 0
- Pending: All remaining
- Blocked: 0

## Latest Update
[2025-04-19]
- Completed performance analyzer system refactoring
- Split large performanceAnalyzer.ts into focused modules
- Implemented proper interfaces and types
- Added comprehensive type system
- Created performance manager

**Complexity Analysis Update:**
- All previously identified files with complexity issues have been refactored or covered with comprehensive tests.
- No files currently exceed complexity thresholds.
- Complexity metrics are now within acceptable limits for all modules.
