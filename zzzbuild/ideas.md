# keep track of the entire conversation history in a project
  - store the history in a file
  - use the history as reference if replying to a message. Most annoying is, when an edit has happened, you get a question and you reply to it. Most times the agent does not recall the previous message or objective given to the agent.
    - a main file should keep track of project objectives
    - add to each message a "forget" button to remove the message from the history
    - add a "chapter" button to add a new history file when starting a new chapter
  - use the history to generate new ideas
  - use the history to generate new code
  - use the history to generate new documentation
  - use the history to generate new tests

  - if possible add a button to restart copilot.
