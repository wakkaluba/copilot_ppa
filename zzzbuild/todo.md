# 🧹 Automated & Expanded Cleanup/Refactoring Task List

## 1. Linting & Code Quality
- [ ] Integrate Husky pre-commit hook for `npm run lint` and `npm run format`
- [ ] Add CI job to block merges on lint/test failures
- [ ] Run `npm run lint:fix` to auto-fix issues
- [ ] Review and refactor code flagged by linter for maintainability
- [ ] Enforce consistent coding standards (e.g., Airbnb, Google) using ESLint/TSLint
- [ ] Set up automated code formatting with Prettier
- [ ] Implement import sorting and deduplication
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies and scripts from `package.json`
- [ ] Optimize asset sizes and formats (images, fonts, etc.)
- [ ] Enable stricter type checking in TypeScript (noImplicitAny, strictNullChecks, etc.)

## 2. Test Suite Automation
- [x] Add/expand tests for CodeQualityService and its exports (test/services/codeQuality/index.js)
- [x] Run the test suite to verify coverage improvements
- [x] Scaffold and expand tests for `src/copilot/copilotIntegrationProvider.ts` and `src/copilot/copilotIntegrationService.ts`
- [ ] Implement detailed test logic and assertions for Copilot integration provider/service
- [ ] Ensure all test files are auto-discovered (update `jest.config.js` if needed)
- [ ] Add/verify `npm run test:watch` for local development
- [ ] Add script to run only changed/affected tests
- [ ] Restore integration and E2E test execution (currently 0/0 passing)
- [ ] Add missing test cases for edge/error scenarios
- [ ] Migrate tests to use React Testing Library or similar for better maintainability
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for critical components and pages
- [ ] Implement visual regression testing for UI components
- [ ] Set up contract testing for API integrations

## 3. Coverage & Reporting
- [ ] Integrate coverage reporting into CI pipeline
- [ ] Auto-generate coverage badges and summary reports
- [ ] Increase coverage for:
  - `src/webview/codeExamples.js` (rendering, interaction)
  - `src/services/logging/FileLogManager.ts` (file operation errors)
  - `src/performance/bottleneckDetector.js` (performance analysis)
  - All files marked ⏳ in code-coverage.md and test-coverage-report.md
- [ ] Add tests for high-priority categories: LLM providers, vector DBs, UI components, performance tools, refactoring services
- [ ] Set up code quality gates (e.g., SonarQube, CodeClimate) in CI
- [ ] Generate and publish test report summaries to a shared location

## 4. Utility & Refactoring Scripts
- [ ] Schedule weekly runs for:
  - `zzzscripts/analyze_code_quality.js`
  - `zzzscripts/cleanup-orphaned-code.js`
  - `zzzscripts/identify-unused-code.js`
  - `zzzscripts/improve-code-coverage.js`
  - `zzzscripts/refactor-unused-code-analyzer.js`
  - `zzzscripts/remove-duplicate-casing-fixer.js`
  - `zzzscripts/remove-unused-code-analyzer.js`
  - `zzzscripts/run-orphaned-code-analysis.js`
  - `zzzscripts/update-refactoring-status.js`
- [ ] Auto-backup and report before deleting code
- [ ] Create a script to update dependencies and lock file maintenance
- [ ] Implement a script to check for and report security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Add a script to optimize and minify assets (CSS, JS, images)
- [ ] Create a script to generate and publish release notes

## 5. Performance & Security
- [ ] Address uncovered branches in performance and security test configs
- [ ] Add/restore performance and security test automation
- [ ] Schedule `npm audit` and `npm outdated` checks; auto-create issues for critical vulnerabilities
- [ ] Integrate security scanning (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) into CI pipeline
- [ ] Set up automated performance monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Optimize critical rendering path and reduce initial load time
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for images and other non-critical resources
- [ ] Enable HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 support on the server
- [ ] Set up a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static assets

## 6. Documentation & Status Tracking
- [ ] Add script to scan for TODOs and incomplete implementations
- [ ] Auto-update status indicators (✅, ⏳, ❗, etc.) in documentation
- [ ] Keep documentation in sync with code changes
- [ ] Generate API documentation from code comments (e.g., JSDoc, TypeDoc)
- [ ] Create and maintain a developer onboarding guide
- [ ] Document common troubleshooting steps and solutions
- [ ] Set up a changelog generator to maintain a history of changes
- [ ] Automate the deployment of documentation to a hosting platform

## 7. Continuous Integration
- [ ] Ensure CI pipeline runs all tests and lint checks
- [ ] Block merges on failed tests or lint errors
- [ ] Integrate coverage and audit checks into CI
- [ ] Set up environment-specific configuration and secrets management
- [ ] Automate deployment to staging and production environments
- [ ] Implement rollback procedures and disaster recovery testing
- [ ] Schedule regular maintenance windows and notifications
- [ ] Monitor CI/CD pipeline performance and optimize for speed

## 8. Refactoring & Maintenance
- [ ] Run `zzzscripts/update-refactoring-status.js` after each refactor PR
- [ ] Auto-update `refactoring-progress.md` and `finished.md`
- [ ] Continue refactoring UI components, core services, and build system as per `refactoring-progress.md`
- [ ] Archive or delete obsolete branches, tags, and releases
- [ ] Review and update third-party service integrations and APIs
- [ ] Optimize database queries and indexes for performance
- [ ] Regularly review and update server and application configurations
- [ ] Conduct periodic security audits and vulnerability assessments
