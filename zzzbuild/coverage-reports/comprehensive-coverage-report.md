### Recent Test Progress

### Files Missing Tests
Below is a categorized list of files still requiring test coverage:

#### Recently Addressed (Fully Tested)
- `src/tools/codeComplexityAnalyzer.js` - Complete test coverage implemented
- `src/tools/codeComplexityAnalyzer.ts` - Complete test coverage implemented

#### Recently Addressed (Fully Tested)
- `src/copilot/copilotIntegrationService.js` - Complete test coverage implemented
- `src/copilot/copilotIntegrationService.ts` - Complete test coverage implemented

#### High Priority (Core Functionality)
- ~~`src/services/workspaceRunner/WorkspaceTaskRunner.js`~~ - Renamed to WorkspaceManager, tests complete
- ~~`src/services/workspaceRunner/WorkspaceTaskRunner.ts`~~ - Renamed to WorkspaceManager, tests complete

#### UI Components
- `src/ui/viewsContainers/activityBarView.js` - Complete test coverage implemented
- `src/ui/viewsContainers/activityBarView.ts` - Complete test coverage implemented

#### Utility Tools
- `tools/fix-all.js` - Complete test coverage implemented

#### Note: Refactoring Scripts
The following refactoring and analysis scripts remain untested but are lower priority as they're not part of the core runtime:
- `zzzscripts/analyze_code_quality.js`
- `zzzscripts/cleanup-orphaned-code.js`
- `zzzscripts/identify-unused-code.js`
- `zzzscripts/improve-code-coverage.js`
- `zzzscripts/refactor-unused-code-analyzer.js`
- `zzzscripts/remove-duplicate-casing-fixer.js`
- `zzzscripts/remove-unused-code-analyzer.js`
- `zzzscripts/run-orphaned-code-analysis.js`
- `zzzscripts/update-refactoring-status.js`

#### Priority Plan for Next Test Implementation
1. Focus on remaining utility files in zzzscripts/ directory (lower priority)

#### Recent Test Coverage Progress
The overall test coverage has increased, with significant improvement in the models and UI components:
- Added comprehensive tests for all interfaces in the models/interfaces.ts file
- Implemented tests for re-exported interfaces in models/index.ts
- Added tests for interfaces/chat.ts and interfaces/chat.js re-exports
- Tests verify proper usage patterns for all interface types
- Implemented comprehensive test cases for optional and required properties
- Tests cover all valid property combinations and type constraints
- Verified WorkspaceManager tests are complete (previously listed as WorkspaceTaskRunner)
- Added comprehensive test suite for ComplexityAnalysisCommand.js/ts
- Added comprehensive test suite for DependencyAnalyzer.js/ts
- Tests cover all public methods and edge cases for both classes
- Implemented comprehensive test cases for error handling in each method
- Created mocks for the CodeComplexityService and appropriate test stubs
- Verified proper resource cleanup with the dispose method

## Bug Fixes
- ðŸ”„ Fix "Invalid value reference" error when entering ask or agent mode in Copilot chat (50%)
  - Implement proper reference checking in CopilotIntegrationService
  - Add error handling for missing workspace context
  - Add validation for chat modes
  - Test fix with different workspace states
