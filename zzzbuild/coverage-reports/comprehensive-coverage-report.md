## Test Case Coverage: Status & Next Steps (2025-05-15)

### Current Status
- All performance-related modules have 100% coverage (statements, branches, functions, lines).
- All public methods, edge cases, error handling, and rarely-hit branches in performance modules are now tested.
- All previously identified complexity issues have been resolved; no files currently exceed complexity thresholds.
- Utility tool `tools/fix-all.js` is fully tested, including error and execution path coverage.
- Test scaffolds exist for all high-priority modules, but some fail due to missing implementations or import errors (see below).
- Coverage percentage: **40.4%** (649/1050 test files, 424 files with associated tests)

### Outstanding Issues & TODOs
- Several high-priority test files (e.g., ModelOptimizationService, UISettingsWebviewService, vectordb/manager, FileLogManager, LLMProviderValidator, ollama-provider, modelManager) are failing due to missing or misnamed implementation files or incorrect import paths.
- Some legacy or low-priority files remain uncovered, but these are not part of the core runtime.

### Next Steps
1. **Fix Failing Test Scaffolds:**
   - Ensure all test imports match the actual file structure and naming in `src/`.
   - For each failing test, confirm the implementation exists and is exported correctly, or update the test to match the correct path/class name.
   - Re-run tests after each fix to confirm resolution.
2. **Expand Coverage:**
   - Continue expanding robust coverage to remaining service, UI, and utility modules as listed in `code-coverage.md`.
   - Scaffold or implement additional missing test files for any uncovered high-priority modules or utilities as identified in the coverage report or `code-coverage.md`.
3. **Maintain & Update:**
   - Maintain and regularly update this report as new tests are added and coverage improves.
   - Review and improve test case coverage percentage by increasing the number of test files and files with associated tests.
4. **Configuration Check:**
   - If a test fails due to a module not found error, check for typos, missing files, or misconfigured Jest/TypeScript paths.
   - Run a clean build (`tsc --build --clean && tsc --build`) if using TypeScript, and ensure Jest is configured to resolve `.ts` files from `src/`.

### Guidance
- Prioritize fixing import/module errors for high-priority test files before adding new tests.
- Use the coverage and error reports to identify the next most impactful area for coverage improvement.
- For persistent import errors, review `tsconfig.json` and `jest.config.js` for path mapping issues.
- Once all high-priority scaffolds pass, focus on increasing the number of files with associated tests to raise the overall coverage percentage.
