---

Files with complexity issues: **None** (all previously identified complexity issues have been resolved; no files currently exceed complexity thresholds)

---

All modules have been refactored or optimized to reduce cyclomatic and cognitive complexity below the configured thresholds. See the summary and KPI sections below for details. Ongoing monitoring is in place to ensure future changes maintain these standards.
