- Started modularizing core functionality
- Implementing proper dependency injection
- Adding comprehensive error handling
- Adding type safety improvements

Next steps:
- Complete service implementations
- Add unit tests
- Implement proper cleanup
- Add real-time monitoring
- Enhance reporting capabilities

## Planned
- Test Infrastructure
