## Overview

This document tracks the status of the comprehensive refactoring effort for the VS Code Copilot PPA (Productivity and Performance Analyzer) extension. The goal is to improve code quality, maintainability, and performance while modernizing the codebase.

## Objectives

1. Improve code organization and modularity
2. Implement consistent patterns and best practices
3. Enhance type safety and error handling
4. Optimize performance and resource usage
5. Improve test coverage
6. Update documentation
7. Remove deprecated code and consolidate duplicated functionality

## Progress Tracking

| Date | Category | Files Processed | Notes |
|------|----------|-----------------|-------|
| 2025-04-19 | Setup | refactoring-plan.md | Created initial refactoring plan |
| 2025-04-19 | Performance | performanceAnalyzer.ts | Split into multiple focused modules with proper interfaces |
| 2025-04-19 | LLM | LLMConnectionManager.ts and related | Refactored into a modular system with improved error handling, state management, and stream processing |

## Current Focus

1. ‚úÖ Split large performance analyzer into smaller, focused modules
2. ‚úÖ Modernize LLM connection management:
   - ‚úÖ Extract connection logic from UI
   - ‚úÖ Implement retry mechanism with backoff
   - ‚úÖ Add connection state management
   - ‚úÖ Improve error handling
3. Enhance security analysis system
4. Update build tools integration

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Completed performanceAnalyzer.ts refactoring:
   - Created base analyzer interface
   - Implemented JavaScript/TypeScript analyzer
   - Added comprehensive type system
   - Created performance manager

2. ‚úÖ Completed LLMConnectionManager refactoring:
   - Created proper type system in src/types/llm.ts
   - Implemented state management with EventEmitter
   - Added connection retry with exponential backoff
   - Separated UI concerns from core connection logic
   - Added streaming support for LLM responses
   - Implemented unified factory for accessing services
   - Created test suite for new components

3. Next: Refactor securityManager.ts:
   - Split into modular components
   - Improve vulnerability scanning
   - Add better reporting capabilities
